# Book-Search-Engine-21

# Description

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack 
(MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users 
to search for books through the Google Books API and manage a personal 
collection of saved books.

The project has been refactored from a RESTful API to utilize GraphQL 
with Apollo Server, enhancing the efficiency of data fetching and management. 

Users can sign up, log in, save books to their account, and view or delete 
their saved books. The frontend is developed using Vite, while the backend 
is powered by an Express server.
